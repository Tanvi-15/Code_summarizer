"Guides the allowed concurrency among update operations. Used as a hint for internal sizing. The
table is internally partitioned to try to permit the indicated number of concurrent updates
without contention. Because assignment of entries to these partitions is not necessarily
uniform, the actual concurrency observed may vary. Ideally, you should choose a value to
accommodate as many threads as will ever concurrently modify the table. Using a significantly
higher value than you need can waste space and time, and a significantly lower value can lead
to thread contention. But overestimates and underestimates within an order of magnitude do not
usually have much noticeable impact. A value of one permits only one thread to modify the cache
at a time, but since read operations and cache loading computations can proceed concurrently,
this still yields higher concurrency than full synchronization.

<p>Defaults to 4. <b>Note:</b>The default may change in the future. If you care about this
value, you should always choose it explicitly.

<p>The current implementation uses the concurrency level to create a fixed number of hashtable
segments, each governed by its own write lock. The segment lock is taken once for each explicit
write, and twice for each cache loading computation (once prior to loading the new value, and
once after loading completes). Much internal cache management is performed at the segment
granularity. For example, access queues and write queues are kept per segment when they are
required by the selected eviction algorithm. As such, when writing unit tests it is not
uncommon to specify {@code concurrencyLevel(1)} in order to achieve more deterministic eviction
behavior.

<p>Note that future implementations may abandon segment locking in favor of more advanced
concurrency controls.

We've got a problem with keeping the identifier on S3 the same as the identifier in the database.
Question: do we really want to load the feed from S3 or do we just want to move the local file to S3 when done?
i.e. user uploads to the datatools back end,
The advantage of having the end users upload to s3, then is that only the files currently being processed need
to be held on our backend server, not the whole queue waiting to be processed.
But I think currently we have some hack where the end user gets a token to upload to S3, which seems bad.
Probably we should have end users upload directly to the backend server, which then loads the feed into RDBMS,
uploads the file to S3 with the unique name supplied by gtfs-lib, and deletes the local file.

"Normalize stop sequences for stop times table so that sequences are all zero-based and increment

of sync for feeds imported into the editor.

NOTE: This happens here instead of as part of post-processing because it's much faster overall to perform
this as an INSERT vs. an UPDATE. It also needs to be done before creating table indexes. There may be some
messiness here as far as using the column metadata to perform the SELECT query with the correct column names, but
it is about an order of magnitude faster than the UPDATE approach.

For example, with the Bronx bus feed, the UPDATE approach took 53 seconds on an un-normalized table (i.e., snapshotting
a table from a direct GTFS load), but it only takes about 8 seconds with the INSERT approach. Additionally, this

"Toggle UUID generator into sequential mode, so the random segment is in order and increases by one. In
sequential mode, there is presumably a desire that UUIDs generated around the same time should begin with similar
characters, but this is difficult in a distributed environment. The solution is to set the counter value based
on a hash of the UTC date and time up to a 10 minute precision. This means that UUID classes initialized at
similar times should start with similar counter values, but this is not guaranteed. If one of these classes
is generating vastly more UUIDs than others, then these counters can become skewed.

Calling this method more than once without toggling back to variable mode has no effect, so it probably makes
more sense to call this from a static context, like your main method or in a class' static initialization.",Sets the counter to use sequential ids.

See authorize() below for @params.",Authorize the application with default authorization code
"Full authorize method.

Starts either an Activity or a dialog which prompts the user to log in to
Facebook and grant the requested permissions to the given application.

This method will, when possible, use Facebook's single sign-on for
Android to obtain an access token. This involves proxying a call through
the Facebook for Android stand-alone application, which will handle the
authentication flow, and return an OAuth access token for making API
calls.

Because this process will not be available for all users, if single
sign-on is not possible, this method will automatically fall back to the
OAuth 2.0 User-Agent flow. In this flow, the user credentials are handled
by Facebook in an embedded WebView, not by the client application. As
such, the dialog makes a network request and renders HTML content rather
than a native UI. The access token is retrieved from a redirect to a
special URL that the WebView handles.

Note that User credentials could be handled natively using the OAuth 2.0
Username and Password Flow, but this is not supported by this SDK.

See http://developers.facebook.com/docs/authentication/ and
http://wiki.oauth.net/OAuth-2 for more details.

Note that this method is asynchronous and the callback will be invoked in
the original calling thread (not in a background thread).

Also note that requests may be made to the API without calling authorize
first, in which case only public information is returned.

IMPORTANT: Note that single sign-on authentication will not function
correctly if you do not include a call to the authorizeCallback() method
in your onActivityResult() function! Please see below for more
information. single sign-on may be disabled by passing FORCE_DIALOG_AUTH

This parameter should not be null -- if you do not require any
permissions, then pass in an empty String array.
@param activityCode
Single sign-on requires an activity result to be called back
to the client application -- if you are waiting on other
activities to return data, pass a custom activity code here to
avoid collisions. If you would like to force the use of legacy
dialog-based authorization, pass FORCE_DIALOG_AUTH for this
parameter. Otherwise just omit this parameter and Facebook
will use a suitable default. See

"5.2.  Relative Resolution

This section describes an algorithm for converting a URI reference
that might be relative to a given base URI into the parsed components
of the reference's target.  The components can then be recomposed, as
described in Section 5.3, to form the target URI.  This algorithm
provides definitive results that can be used to test the output of
other implementations.  Applications may implement relative reference
resolution by using some other algorithm, provided that the results
match what would be given by this one.

5.2.1.  Pre-parse the Base URI

The base URI (Base) is established according to the procedure of
Section 5.1 and parsed into the five main components described in
Section 3.  Note that only the scheme component is required to be
present in a base URI; the other components may be empty or
undefined.  A component is undefined if its associated delimiter does
not appear in the URI reference; the path component is never
undefined, though it may be empty.

Normalization of the base URI, as described in Sections 6.2.2 and
6.2.3, is optional.  A URI reference must be transformed to its
target URI before it can be normalized.

5.2.2.  Transform References

For each URI reference (R), the following pseudocode describes an
algorithm for transforming R into its target URI (T):
-- The URI reference is parsed into the five URI components
--
(R.scheme, R.authority, R.path, R.query, R.fragment) = parse(R);

-- A non-strict parser may ignore a scheme in the reference
-- if it is identical to the base URI's scheme.
--
if ((not strict) and (R.scheme == Base.scheme)) then
undefine(R.scheme);
endif;

if defined(R.scheme) then
T.scheme    = R.scheme;
T.authority = R.authority;
T.path      = remove_dot_segments(R.path);
T.query     = R.query;
else
if defined(R.authority) then
T.authority = R.authority;
T.path      = remove_dot_segments(R.path);
T.query     = R.query;
else
if (R.path == """") then
T.path = Base.path;
if defined(R.query) then
T.query = R.query;
else
T.query = Base.query;
endif;
else
if (R.path starts-with ""/"") then
T.path = remove_dot_segments(R.path);
else
T.path = merge(Base.path, R.path);
T.path = remove_dot_segments(T.path);
endif;
T.query = R.query;
endif;
T.authority = Base.authority;
endif;
T.scheme = Base.scheme;
endif;

T.fragment = R.fragment;","Resolve a path to the target URI.
@param target The URL to resolve relative resolution for
@return A new URIRef with resolved target"
"5.2.3.  Merge Paths

The pseudocode above refers to a ""merge"" routine for merging a
relative-path reference with the path of the base URI.  This is
accomplished as follows:

o  If the base URI has a defined authority component and an empty
path, then return a string consisting of ""/"" concatenated with the
reference's path; otherwise,
o  return a string consisting of the reference's path component
appended to all but the last segment of the base URI's path (i.e.,
excluding any characters after the right-most ""/"" in the base URI
path, or excluding the entire base URI path if it does not contain
any ""/"" characters).

@param hasAuthority","Merges the path and relativePath into a single string.
@param path The current path.
@param relativePath The relative path to be merged with.
@param hasAuthority whether or not this is an authority reference.
@return A new path from {@code path} with specified sub-paths, which can"
"5.2.4.  Remove Dot Segments

The pseudocode also refers to a ""remove_dot_segments"" routine for
interpreting and removing the special ""."" and "".."" complete path
segments from a referenced path.  This is done after the path is
extracted from a reference, whether or not the path was relative, in
order to remove any invalid or extraneous dot-segments prior to
forming the target URI.  Although there are many ways to accomplish
this removal process, we describe a simple method using two string
buffers.

1.  The input buffer is initialized with the now-appended path
components and the output buffer is initialized to the empty
string.

2.  While the input buffer is not empty, loop as follows:

A.  If the input buffer begins with a prefix of ""../"" or ""./"",
then remove that prefix from the input buffer; otherwise,

B.  if the input buffer begins with a prefix of ""/./"" or ""/."",
where ""."" is a complete path segment, then replace that
prefix with ""/"" in the input buffer; otherwise,

C.  if the input buffer begins with a prefix of ""/../"" or ""/.."",
where "".."" is a complete path segment, then replace that
prefix with ""/"" in the input buffer and remove the last
segment and its preceding ""/"" (if any) from the output
buffer; otherwise,

D.  if the input buffer consists only of ""."" or "".."", then remove
that from the input buffer; otherwise,

E.  move the first path segment in the input buffer to the end of
the output buffer, including the initial ""/"" character (if
any) and any subsequent characters up to, but not including,
the next ""/"" character or the end of the input buffer.

3.  Finally, the output buffer is returned as the result of
remove_dot_segments.","Removes dot segments from a path
